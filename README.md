# SimpleGrid - A very basic two-dimensional grid in rectangular coordinates

SimpleGrid is a basic two-dimensional grid implementation using rectangular coordinates. A SimpleGrid object can be instantiated by passing the coordinate of the corner with minimum x and y values, say (x_min, y_min), the width and height of the rectangle. 

It is possible to set an origin point through which x and y axis lines are assumed to pass. *axes* function returns the start and end point coordinates of the horizontal and vertical axis lines.

One can either get the coordinates of major and minor lines (majors/minors) in a direction or end points of these lines in the size of the grid packed in an array as arrays of four elements. (majorLines, minorLines)

Major lines are laid out through the domain of the grid with a separation distance specified. It is possible to skip borders of the domain and origin if a major line is sufficiently close to these locations. 

Specified number of minor lines are placed evenly between adjacent major lines.

It is also possible to obtain the bounding rectangle of the domain.

Also, *svgGroup* static function parses the grid into an svg group node. In Example 2, same grid is regenerated. Before appending the group into a new svg node, some transformation have been applied through the transform attribute.

### Example 1: 

To create a grid that starts from (100,100) with a width of 500 and height of 500 units, 

```const aGrid = new SimpleGrid({xmin:100,ymin:100,width:500,height:500});```

To set an origin at the geometric center of this rectangle, 

```aGrid.origin({type:"set", x:350, y:350}); ```

or

```aGrid.origin({type:"anchor", x:0.5, y:0.5});```

To get the bounding rectangle: 

```aGrid.boundingRectangle();```

To get major lines along x separated by 50 units by skipping the boundaries and origin,

```aGrid.majorLines({distance:50, skipBoundary:true, skipOrigin:true, direction: "x"});```

To get major lines along y separated by 50 units by skipping the boundaries and origin,

```aGrid.majorLines({distance:50, skipBoundary:true, skipOrigin:true, direction: "y"}});```

To get 4 minor lines along x (divides the distance between adjacent major lines 5) between two adjacent grid lines separated by 50 units. 

```aGrid.minorLines({number:4, distance:50, direction:"x"});```

To get 4 minor lines along y (divides the distance between adjacent major lines 5) between two adjacent grid lines separated by 50 units. 

```aGrid.minorLines({number:4, distance:50, direction:"y"});```

In the *test_simplegrid.js*, example grid is used to create the following svg step by step.

Input to the functions are collected in a *settings* object as follows.

```
const settings = {
  geometry: { xmin: 100, ymin: 100, width: 500, height: 500 },
  boundingRectangle: {
    style: "fill:none; stroke:#000000; stroke-width:2",
  },
  origin: { type: "set", x: 350, y: 350 },
  axes: {
    stroke: "#FF0000",
    "stroke-width": 2,
  },
  majorLines: {
    configuration: {
      distance: 50,
      skipBoundary: true,
      skipOrigin: true,
    },
    attributes: {
      stroke: "#00FF00",
      "stroke-width": 1,
    },
  },
  minorLines: {
    configuration: {
      number: 4,
      distance: 50,
    },
    attributes: {
      stroke: "#0000FF",
      "stroke-width": 0.1,
      "stroke-dasharray": "4 1",
    },
  },
};
```


### Example 2

*settings* object in Example 1 is used as an input to the *svgGroup* function and some transformation has been applied before appending the parsed group node into a new svg embedded into a *div* node in the *index.html* file.

```
const gridGroup = SimpleGrid.svgGroup(settings);
gridGroup.setAttributeNS(null, "transform", "scale(0.5) rotate(-5)");
```
